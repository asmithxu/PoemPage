    <h1>Looking for The Gulf Motel</h1>
    <h2>Richard Blanco</h2>
    <p><em>There should be nothing here I don’t remember . . .</em>

        <br>The Gulf Motel with mermaid lampposts
        and ship’s wheel in the lobby should still be
        rising out of the sand like a cake decoration.
        My brother and I should still be pretending
        we don’t know our parents, embarrassing us
        as they roll the luggage cart past the front desk
        loaded with our scruffy suitcases, two-dozen
        loaves of Cuban bread, brown bags bulging
        with enough mangos to last the entire week,
        our espresso pot, the pressure cooker—and
        a pork roast reeking garlic through the lobby.
        All because we can’t afford to eat out, not even
        on vacation, only two hours from our home
        in Miami, but far enough away to be thrilled
        by whiter sands on the west coast of Florida,
        where I should still be for the first time watching
        the sun set instead of rise over the ocean.
        
        <br><em>There should be nothing here I don’t remember . . .</em>
        
        <br>My mother should still be in the kitchenette
        of The Gulf Motel, her daisy sandals from Kmart
        squeaking across the linoleum, still gorgeous
        in her teal swimsuit and amber earrings
        stirring a pot of arroz-con-pollo, adding sprinkles
        of onion powder and dollops of tomato sauce.
        My father should still be in a terrycloth jacket
        smoking, clinking a glass of amber whiskey
        in the sunset at the Gulf Motel, watching us
        dive into the pool, two boys he’ll never see
        grow into men who will be proud of him.
        
        <br><em>There should be nothing here I don’t remember . . .</em>
        
        <br>My brother and I should still be playing Parcheesi,
        my father should still be alive, slow dancing
        with my mother on the sliding-glass balcony
        of The Gulf Motel. No music, only the waves
        keeping time, a song only their minds hear
        ten-thousand nights back to their life in Cuba.
        My mother’s face should still be resting against
        his bare chest like the moon resting on the sea,
        the stars should still be turning around them.
        
        <br><em>There should be nothing here I don’t remember . . .</em>
        
       <br>My brother should still be thirteen, sneaking
        rum in the bathroom, sculpting naked women
        from sand. I should still be eight years old
        dazzled by seashells and how many seconds
        I hold my breath underwater—but I’m not.
        I am thirty-eight, driving up Collier Boulevard,
        looking for The Gulf Motel, for everything
        that should still be, but isn’t. I want to blame
        the condos, their shadows for ruining the beach
        and my past, I want to chase the snowbirds away
        with their tacky mansions and yachts, I want
        to turn the golf courses back into mangroves,
        I want to find The Gulf Motel exactly as it was
        and pretend for a moment, nothing lost is lost.</p>
